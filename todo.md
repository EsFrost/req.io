# TODO

## documentation :

- Once everything is finished, create a documentation file
- Explain in detail the GUI and how it works
- Explain in detail the functionality
- Explain in detail every file

## functionality :

- Add support for cookies <- complex but needed

## UI :

- Add tab management (should be able to scroll left and right) <- this is important

## Website : <- optional

- Create a branch for the website
- Create a website for the app
- Locally create the website files in a different folder to avoid conflicts and confusion

## Localization :

- Try to add localization <- this should be after tab management

## Problems :

- Remove all console logs on code cleanup <- this should happen at the end
