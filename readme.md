# Req-Rep.io

## Req-Rep.io is a simple HTTP client for Windows, Linux and macOS.

It is created using the Electron framework (there are size and performance issues). The reason I chose electron over a more robust solution is that I have worked with ts and electron before and it is faster, easier and more pleasant to develop with.

If the final project's size is too large, please download the source code and build it yourself.

Any and all suggestions are welcome.
